# Ludum Dare Ideas

Theme: Combine Two Incompatible Genres (bleh)

- Rockstar Detective
- Puzzle Shooter
- Puzzle Stealth (I think those are different enough, and would generate
  interesting mechanics)

Chosen idea (for now): Puzzle Stealth

- Mechanics:
  - Avoid Guards
    - React to visual (directional) and aural (non directional) stimuli
    - May get suspicious
  - Solve puzzles
    - Cause visual and aural stimuli
  - Stimuli have:
    - Severity
    - Distance
    - DIrectionality
  - ???
  - Profit
